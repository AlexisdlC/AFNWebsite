                Granular matter refers to a physical system composed of discrete solid particles that interact with each other through physical forces, such as collisions and friction. 
                The study of granular matter encompasses a wide range of systems, from everyday materials like sand and soil, to industrial products like powders and pills. Thermal 
                effects in granular materials are negligible compared to gravitational and frictional effects, hence, granular packings would be expected to remain frozen in local 
                states. Due to the complex interparticle interactions and the resulting collective behavior, granular matter behaves different from fluids, solids, or gases.
                <br><br> 
                One example of this unusual mechanical behavior is the well-known “Janssen’s effect”. When filling a cylindrical column with grains, the weight measured at the bottom 
                of the column does not scale linearly with added mass, but asymptotically saturates towards a constant value. The weight is partially supported by the lateral walls 
                through frictional interactions with the grains. However, we recently observed that the weight measured at the bottom can become larger than the total added mass when 
                the columns are sufficiently small compared to the diameter of the grains [1].

                We also used grains with different geometries (spherical, oblate, and prolate particles), and find that all three geometries display the overshoot in weight. By varying 
                the size of the cylindrical container, we observe a decaying in magnitude of the overshoot proportional to D-1 for the case of the spheres. However, non-spherical 
                geometries show a faster decay of the overshoot peak with the size of the container column.

                We argue that packing effects are behind the quantitative differences between spherical to non-spherical grains. Ellipsoids pack in a more efficient way than spheres.

                Finally, we can connect these results with recent experiments using fire ants as an active version of granular matter. Despite the inherent activity of the ants and their 
                natural tendency to rearrange, the ants also develop force-chain structures that help support the weight of the column (see <a href="research-fireAnts.html">Fire Ants</a>
