                Even though pNipam polymer is charge neutral, charged groups remain on the microgel due to the initiator used for particle
                synthesis and these cause the formation of an ion-cloud at the particle periphery. One striking effect of pNipam microgel
                softness is the spontaneous deswelling behavior at high concentrations, where larger particles deswell to the size of smaller
                ones without direct contact among particles. This behavior results in resolving point defects in the suspension so that
                crystallization can occur in spite of an initially large polydispersity. Our model for the spontaneous deswelling behavior
                is that the counter-ion clouds start to percolate when concentration increases. As a result, there are more ‘free’ ions
                that can contribute to the osmotic pressure. When the osmotic pressure difference becomes larger than the bulk modulus
                of the particle itself, deswelling occurs. Noting that in pNipam microgel suspensions, the largest microgels are also
                the softest ones, the largest deswell first when the osmotic pressure increases and in turn the polydispersity is
                reduced. Thus, our deswelling model describes the change of polydispersity due to deswelling and this relates
                particle softness with phase behavior. Therefore, the characterization of the counter-ion cloud is key to understand
                the phase behavior at high concentrations.

                We use small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to reveal the signal due to the counterion cloud by taking the difference between 
                two samples that contain the same microgels at the essentially same number densities but in the presence of different counterions, 
                sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) or ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). Suspensions containing either ion can be obtained using dialysis. 
                By directly subtracting scattering intensity of Na<sup>+</sup> sample from that of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> sample with number 
                density corrections, we successfully revealed the cloud signal that can be modeled with a spherical shell in the Fourier space, 
                Fig.1. Our results corroborate our expectations that the counterion cloud is located at the particle surface with a width 
                around 40nm. To further demonstrate our theory, we prepared microgel suspension with increasing volume fraction ζ and used SANS 
                to track the particle radii. We observed a plateau of R<sub>sans</sub> at low ζ and observed the spontaneous deswelling of particle
                before the concentration reaches the random close packing density ζ=0.64. By calculating the true volume fraction ϕ<sup>True</sup>

                At ζ<sub>eff</sub>=ϕ<sub>eff</sub>=1, particles with radius of R<sub>sans</sub>+ΔR occupy all the space in the suspension with 
                percolation of the cloud, which subsequently creates a higher osmotic pressure outside of the particle Π<sub>out</sub>. When this 
                pressure is larger than the bulk modulus of the particle K, the particles get isotropically compressed (red arrow). With this 
                method, we also get the cloud width in the range of 40nm, a reproduceable result from our direct measurements with SANS. Since 
                contributions to osmotic equilibrium due to polymer-solvent mixing and network elasticity are largely independent of 
                suspension concentration, ionic effects turn out to be key to understand the suspension behavior; while at low particle densities 
                free ions can wander inside and outside the microgels, at high particle densities, the overlap of counterion clouds can cause 
                the outside osmotic pressure to increase and to induce deswelling. As a result, any model or simulation aiming to capture 
                the phase behavior and mechanics of nearly all microgel suspensions, which are based on either network-charged or 
                peripherically-charged microgels, should explicitly consider the effect of ions.

                The dynamics of a microgel suspension is highly influenced by particle concentration. In colloidal systems, the volume fraction, 𝜙, acts as the inverse of 
                temperature would in atomic systems. Instead of 𝜙, we use the generalized volume fraction, ζ, since it gets hardly possible to calculate 𝜙 when the microgel particles 
                can shrink and deform.
                <br><br>
                In order to study the dynamics of pNIPAM microgels, we perform 3D Dynamic Light Scattering experiments, where we measure the intensity of laser beams that go through 
                the sample. The difference in permitivity between water and gel particles cause the laser photons to scatter, giving rise to fluctuations in the intensity detection. 
                Then, we can calculate the intensity correlation as a function of lag-time, which is related to the electric field correlation via the Siegert relation [1]. 
                Its normalized version, including a correction K, reads as: 𝑔<sub>𝐼</sub>(𝑞,𝜏)−1=𝐾|𝑔<sub>𝐸</sub> (𝑞,𝜏)|<sup>2</sup>.
                <br><br>
                The parameter K(≤1) gives the signal to noise ratio, including misalignments in the setup, as well as  signal lost because of multiple scattering events. The intensity 
                correlation decays with lag time, as measurements  tend to lose there relation as the time between events grows higher. In a monodisperse system of diffusive particles 
                undergoing Brownian motion, the field correlation decays exponentially. Its expression, along with the Stokes-Einstein equation can then be used to infer the 
                hydrodynamic radius of the particles, 𝑅<sub>h</sub>: |𝑔<sub>𝐸</sub>(𝑞,𝜏)|=exp(−𝐷𝑞^<sup>2</sup> 𝜏) ; 𝑅<sub>ℎ</sub>=(𝑘<sub>𝐵</sub> 𝑇)/(6𝜋𝜂<sub>𝑠</sub> 𝐷).
                <br><br>
                Assuming we know the solvent viscosity, we can perform experiments at different angles to do a linear regression. At each angle, we can define the relaxation time 
                (or frequency): 𝜏<usb>0</usb>=(𝐷𝑞<sup>2</sup> )<sup>(−1)</sup>=(Γ<sub>0</sub> )<sup>(−1)</sup>. If the system if concentrated, the correlation dependence on lag time 
                isn’t that simple. Instead, it shows a first decay, associated to particles jiggling, and a second one, at longer times, associated the particles escaping their cage. 
                We note the structural time relaxation associated to this decay by τ_α. The long time decay is well described by a stretched exponential [2]: 
                𝑔<sub>𝐼</sub>−1 ∝ exp(−2(𝜏/𝜏<sub>𝛼</sub> )<sup>𝛽</sup> ).
                <br><br>
                Our pNIPAM microgel is responsive to changes in temperature and pH, affecting its affinity with water. A low temperature and high pH will result in a swollen gel, 
                while the opposite conditions will make it shrink. pNIPAM is known to undergo a LCST phase transition around 32°C. These changes in solute-solvent interaction are 
                described by Flory-Rehner theory. Since we want to use the “same system” at all moment, we only change the volume fraction of our hydrogel.
                <br><br>
                However, this change has a huge effect in the dynamics of the system. In the diffusive limit, we have τ<sub>0</sub>∼1 s. However, for the highest volume fractions, 
                we get a final decay characterized by τ<sub>α</sub>, which is 3 or 4 orders of magnitude higher than  τ<sub>0</sub>. This fact is slightly inconvenient for the data 
                acquisition. The equipment we use calculates g_I using a correlator, which allows us to sample at τ∼10<sup>(-8)</sup>s. However, its maximum sample time is limitted too. 
                Since the detector records the count rate history, with a sample time t<sub>S</sub>, we can reconstruct g<sub>I</sub> for τ=n t<sub>S</sub>. We use both versions of 
                the correlation function, showing how they overlap in the middle range.
                <br><br>
                Another important detail to mention is that, when studying the decorrelation of this system, it’s generally more visual to represent times logarithmically. In fact, 
                the correlator space its results pseudo-logarithmically. When we try to fit the data to a particular functional form, this spacing ensures that the fit isn’t biased 
                towards the longer times (for which there would be more data if the spacing was linear), where the noise is bigger. Because of that, we restrict the values for this 
                second correlation function to a logarithmically spaced set. Lastly, we want to fit the long time correlation function. To do that in a methodic way, we construct 
                fits going from one point to the last and calculate χ^2 to estimate the error of the fit. We repeat this changing the starting point, and select the fit that minimizes 
                the error.
                <br><br>
                As we can see, the fit starts after the first “decorrelation step” has taken place. The shortest time value is around 2.5 s, and we obtain the relaxation time 
                τ<sub>α</sub>=(4.4±0.4)·10<sup>3</sup> s.
