                Liquid crystals are partially ordered materials that constitute a phase of matter between solids and liquids. They present long range orientational order and some broken
                translational symmetries which allows them to flow in at least 1D. One of the most paradigmatic cases are nematic liquid crystals, which are made of anisotropic building 
                blocks that tend to align in the same direction while preserving all of its translational symmetries allowing it to flow like a simple liquid. Moreover, nematic liquid 
                crystals can be described in the continuum approach by an apolar vector (director) field and an order parameter measuring how well the building blocks align in average at 
                each point.
                <br><br>
                Since they can be described by an apolar vector field, they can present topological defects, which are singularities in the director field that can not be removed by a 
                continuous deformation of the director and are characterized by their topological charge (figure 1). These topological defects are able to preserve their own existence and 
                interact between each other through the elasticity of the medium, having attractive or repulsive interactions.

                When confining a nematic liquid crystal into different geometries and topologies, the imposed boundary conditions can prevent the liquid crystal from achieving the locally
                 preferred configuration everywhere leading to a frustrated configuration. This is specially exemplified by the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem, which states that if we have a 
                 director field tangent to a compact boundaryless surface, then the total topological charge (index, χ) of the confined director field is related to the number of handles of
                  the surface (genus, g) by χ=2(1-g). This means that a director field confined to the surface of a sphere not only can not achieve the uniform parallel configuration it 
                  would prefer but that it also needs to have topological defects to fulfil the total topological charge of +2 imposed by the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem. Moreover, in the
                   case of a torus there is no need for topological defects to appear since the total topological charge must be zero, while for a double torus the total topological charge
                    must be -2 (figure 2).

                    For the sphere a configuration with two +1 defects and another with four +1/2 defects (both with total topological charge of +2) is shown. For the torus and double torus, 
                    a defect free configuration and a configuration with two -1 defects is shown respectively.

                While the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem is a mathematical constrain, it is the physics of the system the one that determines the exact configuration that the system acquires
                 through minimization of the free energy.

                The main objective of this project is to study equilibrium and dynamic aspects of topological defects in different geometries and topologies, more specifically, 
                how topology and geometry dictates the organization of ordered materials and how the curvature affects the dynamics of topological defects, which can be seen as “charges” 
                in some cases.

                One of the systems of interest corresponds to a nematic liquid crystal (5CB) solid torus. The toroidal droplet is generated by the injection of the liquid crystal into a rotating 
                cuvette filled with a yield stress material (figure 3). The yield stress material is able to stabilize the droplet due to its solid behaviour below the yield stress. Previous work 
                in the group showed that instead of relaxing to the defect-free axially dull configuration, the nematic torus relaxed into a defect-free double twisted structure due the 
                saddle-splay elastic term [1]. More interestingly, if one heats the liquid crystal to its isotropic phase and let it cool back into the nematic phase, it rarely relaxes back 
                into a defect free configuration (figure 4 left), but relaxes to a configuration filled with stable defect structures (figure 4 right). Moreover, we always find the same two 
                types of defect structures, defect pairs and “X” patterns. Exploring the role of the Gaussian curvature with slenderer tori and even cylinders, the same defect structures are 
                found, which suggest that the Gaussian curvature is not responsible for their appearance and stabilization.

                This toroidal droplets can also be made with other types of liquid crystals, like cholesteric or chromonic liquid crystals. While the cholesteric liquid crystal presents a
                 higher frustation when confined leading to a very rich and complex variety of director configurations, chromonic liquid crystals present a very low twist elastic constant,
                  favouring double twist configurations (Figure?).

                  Another interesting system we aim to study experimentally is that of a nematic liquid crystal confined to the surface of a cone (2D nematic). The case of the cone is
                   geometrically very interesting since it presents zero Gaussian curvature everywhere except at the tip where it has a finite Gaussian curvature accumulated there. This
                    means that a being living on the surface of a cone is not able to tell the difference between the cone and a plane except at the tip. Recent theoretical studies have
                     shown that under the right boundary conditions and for certain cone angles, a +1/2 defect is expelled from the tip to the body of the cone [2]. It would be interesting
                      to test experimentally the theoretical claim.
